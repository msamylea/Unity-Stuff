# Unity-Stuff

Various scripts I've created after trying to find something useful and failing.

ThirdPersonCamera: Drop this script on your main camera. Set the follow target to your character. Camera will follow behind. Pan with Right Mouse button (all directions) or middle mouse button (up and down).  Zoom with scrollwheel.

OpenMenus: Drop this script on a gameObject. Set your UI components that should not always show to Inactive (unclick the checkbox in Inspector). Then in the gameObject holding this script, drag the UI component gameObjects in along with setting the keypress that should open and close it.
